In this chapter, we study the following question:
\begin{Question}\label{Q:Form}
Let $M$ be a connected oriented closed $n$-manifold which is formal in the sense of rational homotopy theory.
Let $\MC$ be the canonical and $\PMC$ the formal pushforward (or Chern-Simons) Maurer-Cartan element for $\dIBL(\CycC(\HDR(M)))$.
Are $\dIBL^\MC(\CycC(\HDR(M)))$ and $\dIBL^\PMC(\CycC(\HDR(M)))$ homotopy equivalent as $\IBLInfty$-algebras?
\end{Question}
We remind that Theorem~\ref{IntroThm:B} states that for a geometrically formal manifold~$M$ with $\HDR^1(M) = 0$, one can pick a special Hodge propagator $\PrpgStd$ such that $\PMC = \MC$ at least for $n\neq 2$.\footnote{We did not prove that the homotopy class of $\dIBL^\PMC(\CycC(\HDR(M)))$ does not depend on $\PrpgStd$, but we expect so.} Question~\ref{Q:Form} asks for a generalization of Theorem~\ref{IntroThm:B}.
In the upcoming sections, we will propose a strategy to answer Question~\ref{Q:Form} in the case of $\HDR^1(M) = 0$, when the expected answer is ``yes''.
Our main tool is the theory of Poincar\'e duality models from~\cite{Lambrechts2007}.
Nevertheless, we also study $\DGA$'s of Hodge type and their small subalgebras from~\cite{Van2019}, which, as we think, naturally fit in the picture.

In Section~\ref{SubSec:CycStr}, we consider $\DGA$'s and define the notions of an orientation and cyclic structure (Definition~\ref{Def:CycStr}), non-degeneracy and Poincar\'e duality (Definition~\ref{Def:PoincDual}), degenerate subspace and non-degenerate quotient (Definition~\ref{Def:NonDegQ}), Hodge decomposition and Hodge pair (Definition~\ref{Def:HodgeDecomp}) and Hodge and small subalgebra from~\cite{Van2019} (Definition~\ref{Def:SmallSubalg}).
We prove that in some cases orientations and cyclic structures are in one-to-one correspondence (Proposition~\ref{Prop:OrAndCyc}) and that being of Hodge type is equivalent to acyclicity of the degenerate subspace (Proposition~\ref{Prop:HodgeAcyc}).
We describe the small subalgebra of~\cite{Van2019} in terms of Kontsevich-Soibelman--like evaluations of rooted binary trees with internal edges labeled with the identity or the standard Hodge homotopy (Proposition~\ref{Prop:SmallDescription}).
We study what happens when we take small subalgebras and non-degenerate quotients iteratively (Proposition~\ref{Prop:PropPropertiessd}).
We give examples when small subalgebras and their non-degenerate quotients differ for different Hodge decompositions of the same $\DGA$ (Examples~\ref{Ex:NonUniqueSmall} and~\ref{Ex:SUsix}).
We prove an important lemma allowing to extend an oriented $\DGA$ to a $\DGA$ of Hodge type later (Lemma~\ref{Lemma:Exte}).
We also prove several little lemmas (Lemmas~\ref{Lem:Pom}, \ref{Lem:PomLemma}, \ref{Lem:AutomaticInjectivity} and~\ref{Eq:LemSmallSub}) and make several remarks (Remarks~\ref{Rem:Eq}, \ref{Rem:VolForms}, \ref{Rem:NonDegPD}, \ref{Rem:RemarkHarm} and~\ref{Rem:OnHodgeSubalg}) which might be useful for future investigations.
We finish with some open questions (Questions~\ref{Q:QuestOnPoinc})

In Section~\ref{SubSec:PoincModel}, we define differential Poincar\'e duality algebras\footnote{The same as cyclic $\DGA$'s for unital commutative $\DGA$'s up to a degree shift and the correspondence of orientations and cyclic structures} and Poincar\'e $\DGA$'s (Definition~\ref{Def:PDGA}), i.e., $\DGA$'s whose homology is a Poincar\'e duality algebra.
We consider Poincar\'e duality models (Definition~\ref{Def:PDModel}).
We argue that a Poincar\'e $\DGA$ is formal if and only if it is formal as a $\DGA$ (Proposition~\ref{Prop:PoincModelOfFormal}).
We prove that an oriented $\DGA$ extends under some conditions to a $\DGA$ of Hodge type (Proposition~\ref{Prop:ExtensionOfHodgeType}) and use it to prove the existence and uniqueness of Poincar\'e duality models in some cases (Propositions~\ref{Prop:ExOfLambrStan} and~\ref{Prop:LambrechtUnique}).
We discuss minimal models (Remark~\ref{Rem:Models}).
We give examples of manifolds whose de Rham algebras do not admit a Poincar\'e duality model with just one arrow (Example~\ref{Ex:NoOneArrow}).
We finish with some open questions (Questions~\ref{Q:QuestionsPonc}).

In Section~\ref{Section:FuncIBL}, we prove functoriality of the canonical $\dIBL^\MC$ construction on differential Poincar\'e duality algebras up to $\IBLInfty$-homotopy (Proposition~\ref{Prop:Functorialityo}) and the uniqueness up to $\IBLInfty$-homotopy in a weak homotopy equivalence class of $\PDGA$'s in some cases (Proposition~\ref{Prop:ExteofDFS}).
We define $\IBLInfty$-formality of a $\PDGA$ (Definition~\ref{Def:IBLFormality}) and conjecture that $\IBLInfty$-formality is implied by $\DGA$-formality (Conjecture~\ref{Con:DGAIBLForm}); in fact, this conjecture holds when Proposition~\ref{Prop:ExteofDFS} holds.
We discuss another relevant notions of formality (Remark~\ref{Rem:Intfor}).
For the de Rham complex of a smooth manifold, we conjecture that the $\IBLInfty$-algebra on cyclic cochains of de Rham cohomology twisted by the Chern-Simons Maurer-Cartan element is homotopy equivalent to the $\dIBL$-algebra on cyclic cochains of the non-degenerate quotient of the small subalgebra of the de Rham complex twisted by the canonical Maurer-Cartan element (Conjecture~\ref{Conj:SmallSimplCon}).
Assuming that the conjectures hold, we obtain a positive answer to Question~\ref{Q:Form} when $\HDR^1(M)=0$ (Conjecture~\ref{Cor:FormCorollary}).
