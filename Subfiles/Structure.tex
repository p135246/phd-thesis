\addchap*{Structure of the thesis}

The thesis consists of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item In Part I, we build a formalism to handle the twisted $\IBLInfty$-algebra on de Rham cohomology so that we can compute examples and formulate the relation to string topology.
%The purpose of this part is to get a feeling for how perturbative Chern-Simons theory and string topology interact. 
 \item In Part~II, we consider some topics which arose during the work on Part~I and may lead to further research.
%Notation and definitions might differ from Part~II since some features of the general theory are not needed and some require subtler treatment.
 \item In Part III --- Appendices, we work out some algebraic details of the theory in Part~I.
\end{itemize}
The three parts were written chronologically and reflect how the author's view of the theory developed. Therefore, the notation and terminology might change.
