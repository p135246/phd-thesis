\addchap*{Structure of the thesis}

The thesis consists of the \emph{Introduction} and the following three parts:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Part I---IBL-infinity chain model:} the goal is to compute the twisted $\IBLInfty$-algebra on de Rham cohomology of $\Sph{n}$ explicitly and compare it to string topology (the original task). A version of Part~I was previously made available online and can be found under the following reference: 
\begin{center}
\fullcite{Hajek2018}
\end{center}
 %The purpose of this part is to get a feeling for how perturbative Chern-Simons theory and string topology interact. 
 \item \emph{Part~II---Follow-up topics:} additional topics discovered by the author while working on Part~I; they may lead to further research.
%Notation and definitions might differ from Part~II since some features of the general theory are not needed and some require subtler treatment.
 \item \emph{Part III---Appendices:} algebraic details of Part~I and related questions.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The three parts were written chronologically and reflect how the author's view of the theory developed. The mathematical notation is consistent but the terminology and understanding might vary slightly from part to part. All in all, Part~I is more about ``getting things done'' while Parts~II and III are more about ``optimizing''.
