  Pavel H\'ajek: {\itshape IBL-Infinity Model of String Topology from Perturbative Chern-Simons Theory}
\end{center}
%We study the twisted $\IBLInfty$-algebra on cyclic cochains of de Rham cohomology. This structure is defined using integrals similar to those in perturbative Chern-Simons theory and is conjectured to give a chain model for Chas-Sullivan string bracket and cobracket. We build a formalism, explicitly compute the structure for the $n$-sphere, formulate some follow-up problems and work out some algebraic details.

Following Cieliebak, Fukaya, Latschev and Volkov, we construct an IBL-infinity chain model for equivariant string topology on cyclic Hochschild cochains of de Rham cohomology. We study its properties and perform explicit computations.\vspace{.8cm}\\
