# My thesis on IBL-infinity algebras, string topology and perturbative Chern-Simons theory
* Topic: Study of a natural IBL-infinity chain model of the Chas-Sullivan IBL-structure on the equivariant loop space homology. This chain model is constructed using perturbative Chern-Simons theory.
* Submitted on October 11, 2019 and defended on December 20, 2019.
* See the repository `phd-defence-talk` for my Ph.D.-defence-talk.
* The submitted and defended version can be found here (the initial commit).
* The final official version with corrections suggested by the supervisor and oponent will be available soon in the library of the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/) or in their electronic archive [OPUS](https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/).
* The most up-to-date version will be available here. I plan to correct some dumb things, add some details and perhaps fork it and use it as a base for research notes about these topics.
