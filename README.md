# My thesis on IBL-infinity algebras, string topology and perturbative Chern-Simons theory
* About: Study of a natural IBL-infinity chain model of the Chas-Sullivan IBL-structure on the equivariant loop space homology. This chain model is constructed using integrals associated to trivalent ribbon graphs from perturbative Chern-Simons theory.
* **Submitted on October 11, 2019** and **defended on December 20, 2019** at the **University of Augsburg, Germany.**
* See the repository [phd-defence-talk](https://github.com/p135246/phd-defence-talk) for my Ph.D.-defence-talk (with a nice Christmass tree in TikZ)
* The **submitted and defended version** is the **initial commit** of this repository.
* The **final official version** with corrections suggested by the supervisor and oponent will be available soon in the library of the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/) or in their electronic archive [OPUS](https://opus.bibliothek.uni-augsburg.de/).
* The **most up-to-date version** will be available here. I plan to correct some dumb things, add some details and perhaps fork it and use it as a base for research notes about these topics. (TODO)
